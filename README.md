# excel-reader

This code creates a web interface for conversing with an AI model using the LLAMA library. It allows users to upload Excel files, extract metadata from the first cell, and use this context in conversations with the AI assistant. The user can ask questions, and the AI will provide answers based on the uploaded file's context.
